Make sure you have React and Node installed on your system
create a new react project by command: npx create-react-app "your app name"
go to the new project directory: cd "your project name"
add a route in your app.js file to SearchTerm.jsx file: <Route path="/" element={<SearchTerm />} /> (made it the root page for simplicity)
start react app :npm start
